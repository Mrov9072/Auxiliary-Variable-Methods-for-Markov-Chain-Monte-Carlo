# Auxiliary MCMC Implementation with PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation of the Auxiliary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to apply the Auxiliary MCMC method to various datasets, including Random Walk, Banana, Funnel, Langevin Mixture, and 2D Normal distribution datasets, and compare its performance with traditional MCMC and Metropolis Hastings algorithms. The method is based on the paper titled "[Paper Title]" by [Author(s)], which you can find [here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1NJqsRctX).

## Key Features

- Implementation of the Auxiliary MCMC algorithm in PyTorch.
- Comparison of the Auxiliary MCMC method with Metropolis Hastings and traditional MCMC algorithms.
- Evaluation on various datasets: Random Walk, Banana, Funnel, Langevin Mixture, and 2D Normal distribution datasets.
